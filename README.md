The project will be answered a couple of questions regarding team capacity within a Fintech team (KYC)
The managers will get answers to the following questions:

QUESTIONS 1: What is the average handling time of each CASE_TYPE? Compare the past 3 complete  months.
QUESTION 2: What is the average number of touchpoints of each CASE_TYPE? Similarly to the previous question, please compare the past 3 complete months.
QUESTION 3: What is the teamâ€™s current capacity? How many cases can the team process on a monthly and weekly basis?
With a new product launch, can handle a new 200 case type_1?
QUESTION 4: Consider a new product launch that will bring an additional workload of 200 CASE_TYPE_1 cases per month. At the current processing speed and volume processed/month, can the team take this workload?

These question were answered using SQL and the answers were visualised in an understandable way to managers
